# Demos of SPARQLed applications

- `bio2rdf` uses a Bio2RDF SPARQL endpoint as a showcase. This demo is the quickest to setup, given that the endpoint is up.
- `swdf` uses a Sesame Native repository SPARQL endpoint as a showcase, with the Semantic Web Dog Food corpus. This demo shows how to create repositories for quick tests.
